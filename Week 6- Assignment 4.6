4.6 
Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay.
Pay should be the normal rate for hours up to 40 and time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. 
Put the logic to do the computation of pay in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation.
The function should return a value. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). 
You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. 
Do not worry about error checking the user input unless you want to - you can assume the user types numbers properly. 
Do not name your variable sum or use the sum() function.

 ******************************************

def computepay(h,r):
    if h>40:
        rate1 = (r*1.5)*(h-40)
    return ((h-5)*r)+rate1
hrs = float(raw_input("Enter Hours:"))
rate = float(raw_input("Enter Rate:"))
p = computepay(hrs,rate)
print (p)

Your Output
498.75

Desired Output
498.75
