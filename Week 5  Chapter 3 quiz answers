4  When you have multiple lines in an if block, how do you indicate the end of the if block?

ans Small All done


8  For the following code, if x < 2: print ‘Below 2’ elif x >= 2: print ‘Two or more’ else: print ‘Something else’. What value of ‘x’ will cause ‘Something else’ to print out?
ans This code will never print ‘Something else’ regardless of the value for ‘x’


9  In the following code (numbers added) – which will be the last line to execute successfully? (1) astr = ‘Hello Bob’; (2) istr = int(astr); (3) print ‘First’, istr; (4) astr = ‘123’; (5) istr = int(astr); (6) print ‘Second’, istr
ans  1


10  For the following code: astr = ‘Hello Bob’ istr = 0 try: istr = int(astr) except: istr = -1. What will the value be for istr after this code executes?
